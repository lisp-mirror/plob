\chapter{About this document}

This document was typeset using Donald Knuth's \TeX\ program with
Leslie Lamport's \LaTeX. The document style \lisp{pretty}\ was derived
by myself from the standard \LaTeX\ style \lisp{report}. The \plob\ 
logo was of course inspired by the \TeX\ logo.

The text of the reference manual was extracted from the original LISP
sources by scanning through all \plob\ source files, gathering the
documentation strings, ordering them alphabetically and writing them
to a \TeX\ source file.  This was done by the LISP module
\lisp{lisp-doc}\ \cite{bib:LispDoc-Manual} written by myself; see the
documentation in the \ps\ file \lisp{plob/\lb{}ps/\lb{}ldocman.ps}\ 
for details.

Two additional supporting substyles have been used: Substyle
\lisp{crossref}\ for cross referencing and substyle
\lisp{lispdoc}\ for generating the 
captions of the items. The former \lisp{crossref}\ substyle was
inspired from the \verb|\label| and \verb|\ref| macros found in
\LaTeX; the latter \lisp{lispdoc}\ substyle was initially derived by
me from the style file \lisp{spec}\ used in writing chapter~6 of
\cite{bib:AMOP} and has been heavily extended.
