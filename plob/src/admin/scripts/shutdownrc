# For calling this script directly under Unix, replace the path to
# plobdadmin in the above line to the path matching the local Plob
# installation.

# Script	shutdownrc
#
# Description	Example script for plobdadmin
#
#		To run this script, call:
#			plobdadmin -source scripts/shutdownrc
#		or start plobdadmin interactively by calling:
#			plobdadmin
#		and type:
#			source scripts/shutdown
#		at plobdadmin's prompt.
#
#		This script can be used as an example script for
#		shutting down all Plob servers gracefully. See also
#		the comments in script plobdrc.
#
#		It is advisable to suppress reading of
#		${HOME}/.plobdrc when running this script; this can be
#		forced by setting the environment variable PLOBDRC to
#		an empty string and exporting it before calling
#		plobdadmin:
#			PLOBDRC=''; export PLOBDRC	# for bourne shell
#			setenv PLOBDRC ''		# for [t]csh
#			plobdadmin -source scripts/shutdownrc

# Make sure the master database server is running. This step is only

# server:
echo -n Starting master server ...
start
echo done!

# At first, stop all non-master server processes:

# echo -n Terminating server for non-master-database-directory-1 ...
# stop non-master-database-directory-1
# echo done!

# echo -n Terminating server for non-master-database-directory-2 ...
# stop non-master-database-directory-2
# echo done!

# # ...

# echo -n Terminating server for non-master-database-directory-n ...
# stop non-master-database-directory-n
# echo done!

# Stop the master server as the last server; this is important since
# it is used as a server manager for non-master servers:
echo -n Terminating master server ...
stop database
echo done!
