<p>Focusing on application programming, persistency is an issue in
many applications. There are different ways to achieve persistency,
each having its benefits and drawbacks. This tutorial introduces an
object-oriented approach at the example of <a
href="http://www.lisp.de/software/plob">Persistent LISP objects</a>
(aka Plob), an object-oriented, free available, self-contained
database tailored specially for a seamless integration of persistency
into Lisp and CLOS. Topics covered will be:

<ul type="circle">

<li> Database and Lisp concepts: Transactions, locks, schema
evolution, reachability in databases, indexes, orthogonal and
transparent persistency, identity.

<li> Architecture and interna of Plob: Client/server approach,
serverless Plob, internal data representation.

<li> Database specific extensions introduced by Plob: Persistent
packages, persistent symbols, persistent btrees.

<li> Programming with Plob:

<ul type="circle">

<li> Application examples.

<li> Different kinds of usage: Tight binding, loose binding, using the
direct representation.

<li> Persistency in legacy systems, top level declarations.

<li> Performance issues.

<li> Administration of Plob.

</ul>

<li> Installation issues.

</ul>

<p>Participants will learn how to use Plob for their own applications,
and how to take maximum advantage of Plob.

<p>Attendees should be familiar with Lisp. Further knowledge of CLOS
and object-oriented or relational databases is helpful.

<p><em>Heiko Kirschke is working as consultant at CSC Ploenzke,
Hamburg.  Before that, he has been working as a software engineer
within POET Software GmbH, Hamburg, and as a research assistant for
computer science at Hamburg University.  He has practiced computer
science and object-oriented technology for over a decade as a
designer, implementer, researcher and consultant.
</em>

<p>For the tutorial to take place, there must be a minimum number of
binding pre-registrations. The deadline for pre-registration is
Friday, May 7th, 1999.
