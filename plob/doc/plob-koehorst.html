Heiko,

<p>[...]

<p>I am using <a href="Welcome.html" target="_parent">PLOB</a>
together with <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/cl-http/"
target="_parent">CL-HTTP</a> in applications to support our education
(a university study in medicine). Since monday we have a small
application up and running that enables students to work together on a
writing assignment.  PLOB is used to store CLOS objects used to
represent groups, students, the assignment and students' contributions
to it. CL-HTTP is used to generate the interface for students.

<p>The system is dynamic since students add contributions to it. PLOB
is perfect for storing these changes. From the persistent objects it
is easy to re-create all neccessary CL-HTTP-objects (computed
URLS, realms, groups and users ...)

<p>The system will be used the next four weeks by four groups of 8-9
students.

<p>With PLOB it took me a day to implement persistency and the
functions to reinstall the assignments in CL-HTTP (took me a day since
I am not really a programmer ....). Without PLOB it would have been a
pain to do this, and probably impossible given the time I had to
develop the app.
