<h2><a name="about">What is it about?</a></h2>

The system <b>PLOB!</b> (<b>P</b>ersistent <b>L</b>isp
<b>OB</b>jects<b>!</b>) implements orthogonal persistency for LISP and
CLOS objects. Besides offering pure persistency, on the one side it
contains important database features like transactions, locking and
associative search over persistent objects.  On the other side,
<b>PLOB!</b> mimics the features of CLOS' Metaobject Protocol (MOP) as
far as possible, e.g. by its implemented self-describing persistent
objects and support for class changes promoted dynamically to
persistent objects (schema evolution).

<h3>Transparent Persistency</h3>

An important topic was to make the interface between LISP and
persistency as transparent to the user as possible, without
sacrificing efficiency.  <b>PLOB!</b> solves both problems: By
employing the possibilites of CLOS' MOP, the user interface to
persistency is as simple as it can be. In fact, using only a few
statements of LISP code will make instances of CLOS classes
persistent, e.g.

<blockquote><pre>
CL-USER 3 > (defclass person ()
              ((name :initarg :name <i>:index (btree :test equal)</i>))
              <i>(:metaclass persistent-metaclass)</i>)
</pre></blockquote>

declares a class <code>person</code> with its instances being
persistent and an index for associative search on its slot
<code>name</code> (actually, the class metaobject which represents the
class <code>person</code> itself will become persistent, too).  Using
some other statements will make ordinary LISP and structure objects
persistent. It is also possible to make CLOS objects persistent which
are out of the user's control, for example, instances where the
<code>defclass</code> defining the class is not available and cannot
be modified as indicated in the example above.  Besides that,
<b>PLOB!</b> has the notion of persistent packages and persistent
symbols for binding persistent objects:

<blockquote><pre>
CL-USER 4 > (setf #!*a-person*
                  (make-instance 'person :name "Kirschke"))
</pre></blockquote>

will bind the persistent instance generated from the
<code>make-instance</code> call to the persistent symbol
<code>*a-person*</code>. Similar to transient packages and symbols, an
object can be bound to a persistent symbol and thereby gets persistent
and identifyable:

<blockquote><code>
CL-USER 5 > (setf #!*a-string* "A persistent string.")
</CODE><br><em>... some years and LISP processes later ...</em>
<br><code>
CL-USER 99 > #!*a-string*
<br>"A persistent string."
</code></blockquote>

<h3>Client/server architecture</h3>

<p><b>PLOB!</b>'s architecture is a true client/server-approach,
communicating by UNIX' standard RPCs. The server administers a
persistent object space; one or more clients can access the persistent
objects contained in the persistent object space.  The multi-user
access is completely serialized, since the implemented transactions
and locking algorithm results in an isolation level of 3 according to
the SQL-92 definition.  The server is a UNIX process running on one of
the machines mentioned below; the clients are processes running one of
the LISP systems mentioned below (especially, clients with different
LISP systems can connect concurrently to one server). By using UNIX'
standard RPCs, heterogenous operation is supported too, i.e. the
server and client can run on different operating or LISP systems.
Access to the persistent object space can be allowed or denied on a
per-host level.

<h3>Efficiency</h3>

Efficiency is gained by the low-level layers implemented in C, coupled
with sophisticated data modelling and object handling. By implementing
most of LISP's base types directly as base types into <b>PLOB!</b>,
the requirement for time-consuming conversions between transient LISP
objects and the persistent objects stored within the persistent object
space is kept to a minimum. To reduce the data exchange between client
and server, the client code provides for object preallocation and
object caching. A reference from a referencing persistent object to a
referenced persistent object can be marked as being
<em>dependent</em>; when a client loads the referee, the referenced
object will be transmitted within the same data block to the client,
too.

<h3>Database features</h3>

Persistency itself is only half of the business; besides that,
<b>PLOB!</b> has implemented many database features, namely
transactions, locks and indices.  Each access to persistent objects is
embedded into well-formed transactions, either by an explicit
transaction block opened by the user's code:

<blockquote><code> CL-USER 6 > (with-transaction ()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(setf #!*a-string* "Next persistent string.")
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</CODE><em> ... lots of more code ...</em>
<code>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(setf #!*b-string* "Second string."))
</code></blockquote>

or, if the user didn't specify a transaction block, <b>PLOB!</b> will
surround each access by a transaction internally. In the above
example, embedding the code into a transaction assures that either all
changes done to persistent objects in the block will be committed to
the persistent object space or, e.g. in the case of an error at
proceeding the statements in the block, none of the changes will be
promoted to the database. Serialization between concurrent
transactions is provided by the two-phase transaction model adopted
within <b>PLOB!</b>

<p>The precondition for a transaction to be well-formed is that each
object accessed within a transaction is reserved for the accessor;
this is accomplished by <b>PLOB</b>'s hierarchical lock
protocol. Locks can be requested on one of the levels slot, object or
whole database with the modes read, write or read-only. Page locking
is not supported, since this makes no sense for the heterogenous
population found in an object-oriented database.

<p>For indices, <b>PLOB!</b> has persistent btrees, which are used
internally for various tables and are made available for the user's
purpose too as shown already above in the <kbd>person</kbd> class
example. It is also possible to use btrees directly:

<blockquote><pre>
CL-USER 7 > (setf *my-btree* (make-btree :test 'equal))
</pre></blockquote>

will set <kbd>*my-btree*</kbd> to a persistent btree. The operations
on persistent btrees are very similar to those of hash tables, with
the difference of the keys being sorted. (Of course, LISP's hash
tables are supported too; <b>PLOB!</b> infringes no mapping from hash
tables to btrees.)

<h2><a name="requirements">System requirements for a successfull
installation</a></h2>

<b>PLOB!</b> is distributed as free software, see the <a
href="#UsersGuide">User's Guide</a> for details.  <b>PLOB!</b> will
run on the following LISP and operating systems:

<dl>
<dt><b>LISP systems</b>

<dd>On Unix, <a
href="http://www.xanalys.com/software_tools/products/lwu.html"
target="_parent">Harlequin LispWorks Common LISP</a> version 3.2.2 and
4.1 and <a href="http://www.franz.com/products/unix.html"
target="_parent">Franz Allegro Common LISP</a> version 4.3 and 5.0
beta are supported.  On Windows/NT, <a

target="_parent">Harlequin LispWorks Common LISP</a> version 4.0.1 and
4.1 and <a href="http://www.franz.com/products/acl-win5.0.html">Franz

href="http://www.franz.com/products/acl-nt.html"
target="_parent">Franz Allegro Common LISP</a> version 4.3.2 for
Windows/NT has not been checked.

<dt><b>Operating systems</b>

<dd> Full supported are Solaris 2.x, IRIX 6.x, Linux kernel version
2.x, Windows/NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. For client-only installations on
other operating systems, see the explanations given below.

<dt><b>System Resources needed</b>

<dd>The complete installation will take around 50 MB disk space, plus
the space allocated by the persistent objects administered by
<b>PLOB</b>. The memory requirements for the client are around 32 MB,
the server should be able to run with less memory.</dd>

</dl>

The server of <b>PLOB!</b> uses the POSTORE subsystem, created within
the scope of the persistent programming language
<a href="http://www-ppg.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/Info/Napier88.html" target="_parent">
Napier88</a> at the University of St. Andrews.  Since the copyright on
POSTORE is owned by the University of St. Andrews, a server
installation is possible on request to <a
href="mailto:Heiko.Kirschke@acm.org">me</a> for other operating
systems.  A client-only installation should be possible for other
operating systems with the distribution provided here, but requires a
Solaris, IRIX, Linux or Windows/NT machine running the <b>PLOB</b>
server near the client.

Between 2.09 and 2.10, <b>PLOB</b>'s internal API between the
client and server code has changed. This means for switching from 2.09
to 2.10, all layers except the database layer must use the new 2.10
code; PLOB might crash when the 2.10 client code is used with a 2.09
server. So, take care for using the 2.10 LISP code, the 2.10 client
DLL and the 2.10 server. Doing a 2.10 standard installation will
overwrite the old 2.09 server binary. The 2.10 components are able to
work on pre-2.10 databases.

<h2>Bugfixes for version 2.09</a></h2>

None available.

<h2>Bugfixes for version 2.08</h2>

<h3>Serverless mode for LispWorks 3.2 on Solaris</h3>

The serverless mode in LispWorks Common LISP 3.2/Solaris crashes with
a segmentation violation when the last database is closed. To fix
this, change file <kbd>plob-2.08/src/lispworks/plob-low.lisp</kbd>
around line 310 to:

<blockquote><pre>
(defparameter *max-lisp-addr*
    (or
     #+(and :allegro :alpha)
     (+ (max #x30000000 #x54000000) *heap-spare-size*)
     #+(and :allegro :hpux)
     (+ (max #x20000000 #x64000000) *heap-spare-size*)
     #+(and :allegro :mips)

     (logand #xff000000 (+ (sys::object-address nil) #x20000000)))
  #+:lisp-doc "... documentation omitted here ...")
</pre></blockquote>

Thanks again to Harlequin's excellent support on LispWorks for
supplying the information necessary to fix this bug.

<h3>Bug in installation script</h3>

After unpacking <kbd>plob-2.08.tar</kbd> and before starting an
installation, change file <kbd>plob-2.08/conf/make.server.in</kbd>
around line 63 from:

<blockquote><pre>
MkCopyRule($(DEFAULTROOT) slash, \
           $(LIBDIR) slash, \
           fileExe(plobdadmin))
</pre></blockquote>

to:

<blockquote><pre>
MkCopyRule($(DEFAULTROOT) slash, \
           $(BINDIR) slash, \
           fileExe(plobdadmin))
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Upgrading from Plob 2.08 to Plob 2.08a</h3>

Plob 2.08a contains some minor bug fixes in some of the install
scripts and the documentation, and some performance improvements for
inserting bulk data into a database.

<p>For already done downloads of 2.08, the archive <a
href="upgrade-2.08a.tar.gz">upgrade-2.08a.tar.gz</a> contains all
changed files. For installing the archive, unpack it onto the current
2.08 installation, and in directory <kbd>plob-2.08</kbd>, call
<kbd>make config</kbd> anew.

<h3>ACL 5.0 for NT's debugger has problems getting back to toplevel
listener</h3>

With ACL 5.0 for NT, there is a problem with CERRORs raised from the
lower C layer of <b>PLOB</b>: A <kbd>:pop</kbd> does not return to the
toplevel listener, but raises the CERROR anew. This seems to be a bug
in ACL 5.0 for NT's debugger. The workaround for the moment is for a
CERROR raised because of a not running <b>PLOB</b> server to start the
server manually; this will return ACL 5.0 for NT to the toplevel
listener.

<p>For this reason, <kbd>plob::*verbose*</kbd> should not be set to
<kbd>nil</kbd> when running under ACL 5.0 for NT, since this might put
<b>PLOB</b> into an infinite loop.

<h3><kbd>+plob-{min,max}-marker+</kbd> as {lower,upper} interval
bounds</h3>

When using the <kbd>+plob-{min,max}-marker+</kbd> as {lower,upper}
interval bounds for a search in a btree, the search will start always
on the {first,last} element in the btree, that means, the compare
criterion used is always {<kbd>&gt;=</kbd>,<kbd>&lt;=</kbd>}, even
if {<kbd>&gt;</kbd>,<kbd>&lt;</kbd>} has been specified to get the
{second,last before the last} element as first element of the
interval.

<h3>Bitvectors in LispWorks Common LISP 4.0.1</h3>

Please note that with the LispWorks 4.0.1 for Windows/NT client,
bitvectors cannot be stored and loaded at the moment. This is due to
the new foreign language interface introduced with 4.0.1; Harlequin is
aware of this problem and will extend the interface.

<p></p><hr>

<h2><a name="changes">Changes from version 2.09 to 2.10</a></h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li> Support for Allegro Common LISP 6.0 has been added.

<li> Further support for IRIX is still unclear. Contact <a
href="mailto:Heiko.Kirschke@acm.org">me</a> if you are interested in
an IRIX port.

<li> The sources are now maintained within CVS. Currently, I try to
set up a CVS archive at <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/plob">sourceforge</a> and a
possibility for anonymous ftp.

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.08 to 2.09</a></h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li> Multiple databases on a single system are now better supported;
for disciminating different databases, the port number is now used
instead of the RPC version number. Thanks to Jon Dyte for providing
the hint to this improvement.

<li> Structure classes are now stored correctly in LispWorks 4, too.

<li> Build is now completely supported for CYGWIN on Windows/NT.

<li> In <kbd>ps/<a href="plobelugm99.pdf">plobelugm99.pdf</a></kbd>,
find my paper on the architecture of <b>PLOB!</b> presented at ELUGM
'99 in Amsterdam.

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.07 to 2.08</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li> Various bugfixes

<ul type="circle">

<li> Short-floats now work again for LispWorks 3.2

<li> Bignums should now work for ACL 5.0.

<li> The client handling for <kbd>write-lock-store</kbd> did not work
properly under certain circumstances; this has been fixed. At end of
transaction of a write-locked database, the server spent much time
unlocking not locked objects; this has been fixed.

<li> Object preallocation had a bug which made the preallocation not
work at all under certain circumstances; this has been fixed.

<li> The client/server marshalling code has been fixed to pass objects
correctly between heterogenous, arbitrary architectures. Earlier
versions had problems with such configurations for example when
handling floats or bignums.

</ul>

<li> The server code has been made 64 bit proof (the client code is
already 64 bit proof).

<li> The <kbd>plobdadmin</kbd> utility has been rewritten in C; its
functionality has been extended. See file
<kbd>plob-2.08/src/admin/README</kbd> for details; directory
<kbd>plob-2.08/src/admin/scripts/</kbd> contains example scripts for
using <kbd>plobdadmin</kbd> automatically.

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.06 to 2.07</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li> Support for ACL 5.0 beta on Windows/NT has been added.

<li> A serverless mode has been added. This has the following
advantages:
<ul type="circle">

<li> Performance is improved by a factor of at least 2 compared to a
client connected to a server running on <kbd>localhost</kbd>.  Please
consult the user's guide, chapter `Administration', section `Running
<b>PLOB!</b> serverless', and chapter `Database functionality',
section `Performance' for details.

<li> No server process or server administration is needed at all.

</ul>

For technical reasons, the serverless mode works only for LispWorks
Common LISP 4.0.1 on Windows/NT, for Allegro Common LISP 5.0 on
Windows/NT and Allegro Common LISP 4.3 on Solaris. It definitely does
not work for LispWorks 3.2.2 on Solaris, Allegro Common LISP 5.0
beta on Linux and Allegro Common LISP 4.3.1 on Irix.

<li> The documentation in the user's guide has been improved:
<ul type="circle">
 
<li> Section 4.1 has been added explaining some database terms as used
in <b>PLOB</b>.

<li> The performance numbers have been moved from the Web page into
section 4.10. The numbers have been corrected, and numbers for
<b>PLOB!</b> running in serverless mode have been added.

<li> Section 5.3 has been added explaining the serverless mode of
<b>PLOB</b>.

<li> Section D.2 has been added clarifying how to submit a bug
report.

</ul>

<li> The license terms have changed. <b>PLOB</b> is no longer
published under the GNU General Public License, but as free
software. See section D.6 in the user's guide for details.

<li> Bugfix: For LispWorks 3.2.2, the library containing the foreign
function code is now properly loaded.

<li> Bugfix: <b>PLOB</b>'s internal `metaheap' conflicted with the
local LISP thread's persistent heap when doing locking [on `store'
level].

<li> Bugfix: The <kbd>:type</kbd> slot option was not passed to a
class definition for classes which had been compiled from a class
description into the current LISP image.

<li> Bugfix: Although <kbd>plob::*verbose*</kbd> was set to
<kbd>nil</kbd>, some <kbd>cerror</kbd>s had not been continued
automatically.

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.05 to 2.06</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li> The btree interface has been completed and improved:

<ul type="circle">

<li> Mapping is now possible for btree keys in left-sided or
right-sided opened or closed intervals.

<li> The mapping through a btree's keys can now be done ascending or
descending.

<li> A new access method has been added for btrees. It is silimar to a
file interface or to the <em>cursor</em> interface known from SQL.
Please consult the user's guide, chapter `Database functionality',
section `Persistent btrees', subsection `Cursors on btrees' for
details.

</ul>

<li> Support for ACL 5.0 beta on Linux has been added.

<li> Faster allocation of dynamic sized objects (strings and vectors).

<li> More simple and (hopefully :-) more robust installation
procedure.

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.04 to 2.05</h2>

In 2.04, the installation script had a bug, this has been fixed.
Following new features have been introduced:

<ul type="disc">

<li> Full support for LispWorks Common LISP 4.0.1 for Windows/NT
clients. In conjunction with <b>PLOB</b>'s Windows/NT server, the
whole system can run on a single Windows/NT machine.

<li> Improved inspector methods for LispWorks Common LISP.

<li> The client C code is now multithread safe.

<li>Simplified installation on Windows/NT, see the <a
href="#InstallationGuide">Installation Guide</a> for details.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Changes from version 2.02 to 2.04</h2>

The 2.02 distribution had some minor flaws, namely storing and loading
of defstruct instances and hash tables did not work properly; this has
been fixed. Besides that, these new features have been introduced:

<ul type="disc">

<li> The restriction of only one open database per server machine does
not longer exist. Now, a server can open any (reasonable) number of
databases. Clients are still restricted to one open database at a
time.

<li> New databases can now be created from the client's side.

<li> Url-like database names have been introduced.

<li> The distribution now contains a <b>PLOB!</b> server running under
Windows/NT 4.0

<li> Improvements on btrees: Page size can now be requested and set,
the minimum and maximum key of a btree can now be requested.

<li> Built-in classes are now represented as first class objects.</li>

</ul>

NB: Version 2.03 has never been a public version but a private one for
my main customer, so it is omitted here.
