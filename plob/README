	ftp Download
	============

2.10: ftp download is currently not possible from 
ftp://kogs1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/software/plob/.

The files on http://www.lisp.de/software/plob are mirrored to
ftp://kogs1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/pub/software/plob/. Don't forget
to switch to binary mode (ftp command `bin'). If you encounter
problems with timeouts, try to download the divided archive in files
plob-2.10.tar.gz.aa to plob-2.10.tar.gz.ah. On Unix, the original
archive can be restored after having downloaded all files by:

    cat plob-2.10.tar.gz.* > plob-2.10.tar.gz

For Windows/NT, download script restore-plob.bat into the same
directory as the archive components and call

    restore-plob

to restore the complete archive from its components.

	Release notes
	=============

Release 2.10 supports ACL 6.0.

Between 2.09 and 2.10, PLOB's internal API between the client and
server code has changed. This means for switching from 2.09 to 2.10,
all layers except the database layer must use the new 2.10 code; PLOB
might crash when the 2.10 client code is used with a 2.09 server. So,
take care for using the 2.10 LISP code, the 2.10 client DLL and the
2.10 server. Doing a 2.10 standard installation will overwrite the old
2.09 server binary. The 2.10 components are able to work on pre-2.10
databases.

	Latest bug fixes
	================

Before starting an installation, please consult the `Bugfixes' section
referenced by http://www.lisp.de/software/plob/, since the archive may
contain not yet fixed bugs.

	Documentation
	=============

Please read the documentation found in subdirectory plob-2.10/ps;
these are the PostScript files:

            | Pa- | 
   File     | ges | Description; language
------------+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------
 install.ps |   4 | How to install PLOB!; english
------------+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All of these files are compiled for two-sided printing. For
install.ps, userg.ps, eref.ps and iref.ps, there are also hyperlinked
PDF files located in the same directory; see
http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html for a reader of
PDF files. The PDF files are compiled for one-sided printing.

The file ldocman.ps describes a general-purpose LISP documentation
extraction module used for building the reference manual; this can be
used indepently from PLOB! to extract a reference manual from LISP
sources looking similar to the standard set by [CLtLII].

Further understandings about the design philosophy behind PLOB! can be
found in diplom.ps (written in german language).

	Quick Installation
	==================

Here's the roadmap to a quick installation of PLOB!:

1. In the shell, call

	make config

   in the directory containing this readme file and answer all
   questions (most of the questions already have suitable default
   answers).

2. Depending on your LISP target system (LispWorks or Allegro), cd
   either to

	cd plob-2.10/src/lispworks
   or
	cd plob-2.10/src/allegro

   For Windows/NT only: cd always to plob-2.10/src/allegro
   --------------------

3. Start LispWorks or Allegro Common LISP.

4. For Windows/NT only: Edit file defsystem-plob.lisp. Around line 42,
   -------------------- change the defconstant:

	(defconstant +plob-dir+ ".."
	  #+:lisp-doc "\\plob\\ installation directory.")

   to contain an absolute path to the local PLOB! installation, for
   example:

	(defconstant +plob-dir+ "c:/opt/plob/plob-2.10"
	  #+:lisp-doc "\\plob\\ installation directory.")

5. In the LISP listener, evaluate

	(compile-file "defsystem-plob")
	(load "defsystem-plob")
	(compile-plob)
	(load-plob)

6. That's it. For getting first experiences with PLOB!, compile and
   load plob-2.10/src/example/plob-example.lisp and
   plob-2.10/src/example/plob-quick-tour.lisp

Have fun,
Heiko
