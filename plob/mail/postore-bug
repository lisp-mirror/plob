Subject: Bug in POSTORE


Dear Sir or Madam,

since I don't have an email-address of the POSTORE author(s) I beg you
to forward this mail to him/her/them.

There's a bug in POSTORE, module svmstore.c, function SS_set_lock,
around line 1160:

	psint SS_set_lock( pos )
	psint pos ;
	{
		psint *addr ;

		addr = ( psint * )( ( char * ) disk_vaddr + pos ) ;
		/* HK 30.11.93: Bug: */
		/*
		return( SS_Xmemlock( addr - WORDSIZE ) ) ;
		*/
		return( SS_Xmemlock( addr ) ) ;
	}

The lock word offset of - WORDSIZE is already subtracted in sheap.c,
function SH_set_lock, so doing it in svmstore.c too 'locks' the wrong
memory address.

Sincerely,
Heiko Kirschke
